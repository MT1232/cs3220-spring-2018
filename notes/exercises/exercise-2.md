## Descriptions

In this exercise, we will apply the knowledge we learned from the HTML and CSS
lecture into practice.

To do so, we will implement a couple pages that we will use later in the project.
These are:

* An administration page to control game information (such as game name)
* An administration page to control the game generators meta information
* An administration page to control the game events meta information

The provided mockups can be found below:

## Technical

For the technical requirements wise, you will need to implement a couple different
HTML pages. One is called `admin-info`, one called `admin-events` and last one
called `admin-generators`.

Although functionalities does not need to work just yet. It's important to have
the HTML and CSS there for the sake of this assignment.
