## Lab rules

In lab, everything is open (books, notes, internet, friends, colleagues). In other word,
you are free to ask for helps in order to finish the lab in time.

> Please note the difference between helping and giving out solution. Copying
others' solution is considered as cheating.

> If you are not sure what is helping. Consider yourself as a mentor for other
students. You are helping them by **teaching** them. While teaching,
you can learn some from it as well!

There is only one rule to the lab -- all lab works are due in class unless notify otherwise.
All the requirements of the lab will be given in class, and the lab work will be 
due by the end of class.

## Midterm/final rules

Rules for midterm & final are similar to lab --

* Open book/note
* Open internet
* All works are due in class
* You may ask question to clarify if you are not clear

Except the following difference:

* No discussion/messages with your friends&colleagues
	* Midterm&final are supposed to be testing individuals
* Not like lab, I will not be as helpful

## ADA Statement

Reasonable accommodation will be provided to any student who is registered with
the Office of Students with Disabilities and requests needed accommodation.

## Academic Integrity

Cheating on assignments and exams will not be tolerated. All parties involved
will receive a grade of **F** for the course and be reported to the Computer 
Science Department.
